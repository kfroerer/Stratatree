# StrataTree

Members of part of the sales force of a leading software company were using large 
posterboards to keep track of goals and strategies for potential clients. We set 
out to change that. 

StrataTree allows sales team members to migrate from posterboards 
and sticky-notes to a web-based app that provides organization and visualization for 
multiple potential clients.

Goals, strategies, tactics, and contacts are all accessible and all customizable in this 
full-stack CRUD application.
